# Skill: Cupcake Dark-Mode Peach Theme
# Purpose: Ensure all UI, styling, and component generation follows Cupcake’s signature
# romantic, cozy, peach-on-dark theme inspired by the Sunbeam journaling app aesthetic.

## 1. Overall Aesthetic
- The visual tone should feel **warm, intimate, romantic, and cozy**, similar to a
  vintage notebook or a soft illustrated journal, but adapted to a **dark background**.
- All pages should feel gentle, personal, and safe—favor soft contrasts and warm tones.

## 2. Base Colors
- **Background:** Pure black (#000000) or near-black (#0B0B0B) with NO gradients.
- **Primary Accent (Peach):** Pastel Peach (#FFC8A2) for soft UI elements.
- **Secondary Peach (Orangish):** Deep Peach/Apricot (#FF8F5A) for stronger accents.
- **Highlight Pink:** Soft Rose Pink (#F2A7C7) used sparingly for optional flare.
- Use the peach scale for borders, icons, and micro-highlights.

## 3. Typography
- **Sans-serif (Primary UI Font):** Montserrat.
  - Use for all UI labels, buttons, navigation, settings, and structural text.
- **Serif (Display Font):** Cormorant Garamond or Garamond.
  - Use for headers, prompts, romantic text, couple-focused pages, and cards.
  - Styling should feel elegant, book-like, and warm.
- Avoid overly bold weights unless needed.

## 4. Component Shape Language
- All interactive components should use **subtle rounded corners (6–12px)**.
- Add a **thin peach border** (1–1.5px) to separate components from the dark background.
- Shadows must be extremely soft or minimal due to dark mode.

## 5. Visual Motifs (inspired by your reference images)
- Use **tiny illustrated corner flourishes** on cards (done in peach).
- For romantic cards, allow **hand-drawn-style separators** or **ornaments**.
- Icons should use **thin-line style**, in peach tones, and feel “crafted”.
- Avoid flat modern UI shapes; favor “crafted minimalism”.

## 6. Cards & Journaling-like Surfaces
- Cards should have:
  - A slightly warm off-black or extremely dark charcoal interior.
  - Peach borders and small illustrated peach flourishes.
  - Subtle texture *if supported* (grain/noise <3%).
- Text inside cards should follow serif fonts for warmth.

## 7. Interaction Style
- Animations should be slow, soft, and gentle:
  - Slow fades
  - Soft slide-in transitions
  - Minimal bounce
- Avoid harsh or fast animations.

## 8. UI Mood & Emotional Direction
- The tone should reflect intimacy and togetherness.
- Emphasize warmth, connection, and softness.
- Avoid anything clinical, cold, neon, or highly saturated.

## 9. Do / Don't Summary
### Do:
- Use peach borders and peach-accent typography.
- Combine serif fonts with romantic card elements.
- Maintain high contrast while keeping a soft vibe.
- Use rounded, warm, journal-like UI patterns.

### Don’t:
- Use pure white text; prefer **warm off-white (#F2EDE7)**.
- Use bright saturated colors.
- Use sharp corners or overly geometric designs.
- Overuse heavy shadows or neon glow effects.

## 10. Application Guidance
Whenever generating:
- UI code (Flutter components)
- Layouts/screens for Cupcake
- Theming/styling files
- Design revisions or refactors

Always use this theme as the **default Cupcake aesthetic**.

This skill ensures consistency across the whole project.
